<h1 align="center">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p align="center">I recently started to play DnD and early on we had a problem with the music that we used for atmosphere . We used  playlists from youtube but it was annoying to skip songs or find other playlists . we tried using other options but in the end i decided to make an app for mobile to make our lives easier . I wanted something with features that we needed and couldn't find anywhere else.
After a month i finished the basics and from now on i will continue to add content, features and bug fixes.  </p>
<p>Application Features : </p>
- A library with over 2000 songs split in 46 playlists
- Quick initial loading
- Easy to use UI
- The playlist are categorized
- Fade effect between melodies
- Auto play and shuffle
- Nice looking UI (or so i think :) )
- More upcoming features
